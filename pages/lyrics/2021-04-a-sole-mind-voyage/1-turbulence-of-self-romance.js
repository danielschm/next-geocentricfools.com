            <h1>Turbulence of Self-Romance</h1>
            Self-Romance<br/>
            Self-Romance<br/>
            Self-Romance<br/>
            <br/>
            [Verse 1]<br/>
            Witness to his footsteps, dissolving in sand<br/>
            Accompanied by people, until he got banned<br/>
            Breathing seemed so simple, behind his mask<br/>
            Until only the mirror was able to catch a glance<br/>
            <br/>
            [Chorus]<br/>
            Love is destructive, Love is destructive<br/>
            Love is destructive, Love is destructive<br/>
            Love is destructive, Love is destructive<br/>
            Love is destructive, destructive<br/>
            <br/>
            When its appearance is in self-romance,<br/>
            When its appearance is in self-romance,<br/>
            When its appearance is in self-romance,<br/>
            When its appearance is in self-romance<br/>
            Self-romance<br/>
            <br/>
            [Verse 2]<br/>
            Now he is locked down and forced to be patient<br/>
            An unsuspected being, his only relation<br/>
            Wants to break out, to leave behind his basement<br/>
            Destroying his mirror won´t help him erase this<br/>
            <br/>
            [Chorus]<br/>
            Love is destructive, Love is destructive<br/>
            Love is destructive, Love is destructive<br/>
            Love is destructive, Love is destructive<br/>
            Love is destructive, destructive<br/>
            <br/>
            When its appearance is in self-romance,<br/>
            When its appearance is in self-romance,<br/>
            When its appearance is in self-romance,<br/>
            When its appearance is in self-romance<br/>
            Self-romance<br/>
            <br/>
            [Outro]<br/>
            Self-romance in times of locked up doors<br/>
            “Please, please i need to breathe<br/>
            Fever strikes, my throat is sore,<br/>
            But my red core, suffers even more<br/>
            <br/>
