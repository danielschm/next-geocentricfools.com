            <h1>Exidental Exorcism</h1>
            [Verse 1]<br/>
            Malfunctioned movement, synapses shutting down<br/>
            Mental issues, creeping through (Amen) a man, about to drown<br/>
            Infected by a demon, which turned out to be a ghost<br/>
            The mind in which, he´s floating, unstable is his host<br/>
            <br/>
            [Chorus]<br/>
            Tormented by conspiracies<br/>
            They tried to exorcise his curse<br/>
            Not knowing of the soul inside<br/>
            Confusion is in its worst<br/>
            <br/>
            [Verse 2]<br/>
            Examination follows, as he's tied up to a chair<br/>
            Insanity increases, preachers praying to thin air<br/>
            The spirit in confusion for whom these words are meant (Amen)<br/>
            Has exorcism accidentally revealed existence?<br/>
            <br/>
            [Bridge]<br/>
            <i>[Latin exorcism]</i><br/>
            “Non ultra audeas, serpens callidissime, decipere humanum genus, Dei<br/>
            Ecclesiam persequi, ac Dei electos excutere et cribrare sicut triticum”<br/>
            <br/>
            [Chorus] x2<br/>
            Tormented by conspiracies<br/>
            They tried to exorcise his curse<br/>
            Not knowing of the soul inside<br/>
            Confusion is in its worst<br/>
