            <h1>Bye Byers</h1>
            A lonely soul<br/>
            Floating through my shell<br/>
            So long ago<br/>
            The moment i felt well<br/>
            Obsessed and ill<br/>
            No help is found in pills<br/>
            The will of will<br/>
            Will crack till he lies still<br/>
            <br/>
            Comatose<br/>
            A darkness overdosed<br/>
            Comatose<br/>
            I dive into the cold<br/>
            Bye byers<br/>
            Will fall to sleep<br/>
            Comatose<br/>
            But all feels real<br/>
            <br/>
            Black ink is crawling under your skin,<br/>
            Afraid of the places in the dark, that youÂ´ve slipped in<br/>
            Afraid of these faces, it closed the door, but let us in<br/>
            Hear us crying, no bye byers come back again<br/>
