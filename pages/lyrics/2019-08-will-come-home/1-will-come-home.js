            [Verse 1]<br/>
            Caught in another dimension <br/>
            we don't know which one is right<br/>
            Lights are slowly fading <br/>
            into a never-ending night<br/>
            Got my eyes wide open<br/>
            I’d never blink <br/>
            My blood is pumping faster<br/>
            And I’m falling off my feet<br/>
            <br/>
            [Chorus]<br/>
            I’ve been followed<br/>
            Followed to my home<br/>
            My peace is finally broken<br/>
            And I won’t find myself alone<br/>
            <br/>
            [Verse 2]<br/>
            Thought it had other intentions<br/>
            Seemed to hope my home would lie<br/>
            In sight with no shadow chasing<br/>
            Me into a never-ending fright<br/>
            Lost my mind and broken<br/>
            Into dark I’d sink<br/>
            I stood forefront disaster<br/>
            And found my home so strange to me<br/>
            <br/>
            [Chorus x2]<br/>
        </Container>
    </LyricsPage>
