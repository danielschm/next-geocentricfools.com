            <h1>Rabbit Warren</h1>
            [Verse]<br/>
            Screw that love,<br/>
            My head sits just as high as my true view does,<br/>
            Cause if you fall just keep in mind it’s dangerous,<br/>
            From two miles up the sky you know your brain will crush,<br/>
            And too low down on dusty ground it’s you, looking up,<br/>
            And before you know what’s going on the people will stomp,<br/>
            On you, creative human, from top, death will drop, death will drop.<br/>
            <br/>
            [Chorus]<br/>
            Ohhhh,<br/>
            I’ll take you through my rabbit warren, a<br/>
            place of myself where I am foreign,<br/>
            Doesn’t matter what I say or what it does.<br/>
            As long as you my love and I get lost,<br/>
            As long as you my love and I get lost,<br/>
            As long as you my love and I get lost,<br/>
            As long as you my love and I get lost.<br/>
            <br/>
            [Verse 2]<br/>
            Hey I’m fine,<br/>
            Could just sit here watch the waves go by,<br/>
            I know you got a think for the feel-good type,<br/>
            Can see your pretty smile but I can’t see your eyes,<br/>
            Hidden up so blue next to sweet sunshine,<br/>
            The moment I am doomed as I realize,<br/>
            Accepting every view so I could look in your eyes,<br/>
            Look in your eyes,<br/>
            Look in your eyes.<br/>
            <br/>
            [Chorus]<br/>
            <br/>
