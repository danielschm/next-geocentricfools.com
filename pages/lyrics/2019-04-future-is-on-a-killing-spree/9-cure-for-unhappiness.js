            <h1>Cure For Unhappiness</h1>
            [Verse 1]<br/>
            I´m strolling through the blue<br/>
            Afternoon<br/>
            And you seemed to be amused<br/>
            And after soon<br/>
            The rain will fall onto our roof<br/>
            And wash away the noon<br/>
            <br/>
            The stars, the sky and the moon<br/>
            <br/>
            [Chorus x2]<br/>
            The spaceship has landed<br/>
            On a deserted planet<br/>
            We settled on the ground<br/>
            But now my head just spins around, spins around, spins around….<br/>
            <br/>
            [Verse 2]<br/>
            I´m calling out for you,<br/>
            As if I knew<br/>
            Had a rip in your space shoe<br/>
            Just like the flu<br/>
            The parasite would bloom<br/>
            Inside of you<br/>
            And wash away unpleasant moods<br/>
            <br/>
            So far, so high, so true<br/>
            <br/>
            Oh now I’m infected too, a smile<br/>
            A constant move<br/>
            Oh my life it feels improved<br/>
            <br/>
            So far so high and so true<br/>
            <br/>
            [Chorus x2]<br/>
            The spaceship has landed<br/>
            On a deserted planet<br/>
            We settled on the ground<br/>
            But now my head just spins around, spins around, spins around….<br/>
