            [Intro]<br/>
            Abandoned from you mother earth<br/>
            I am absolutely weightless<br/>
            Zero gravity around me<br/>
            Im floating<br/>
            It feels like eternity<br/>
            Is this a step closer to the future? <br/>
            Then set me back to now<br/>
            <br/>
            [Verse] <br/>
            Gotta land my feet back to ground<br/>
            Been up in space for way too long<br/>
            Knees are weak my head is strong<br/>
            Weighing tons my golden crown<br/>
        </Container>
