            <h1>Future Is On A Killing Spree</h1>
            [Verse]<br/>
            Luminous creatures of the dusk<br/>
            We´re following voices through the dark<br/>
            Vibrant noises, my heart pumps<br/>
            Nebulous spaces, throughout a cyberpunk<br/>
            <br/>
            Solid in pieces, plastic suns<br/>
            Are rising above the metropolitan<br/>
            Atmosphere, our lasting sons <br/>
            And daughters will curse us, for what they´ve become<br/>
            <br/>
            [Chorus]<br/>
            The future´s on a killing spree<br/>
            We´re ruled by our technology<br/>
            The future´s on a killing spree<br/>
            And made a fool out of eternity<br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            [Verse 2]<br/>
            Heavy shakings of the many drills<br/>
            Digging up riches from a passed-out world<br/>
            High end places, lie above the slums<br/>
            Dreaming of freedom, beyond the horizon<br/>
            <br/>
            No more diseases, artificial skins<br/>
            Collapsing in nowhere, we pay for our sins<br/>
            Of destroyin´ the sphere, that we lived in<br/>
            Venomous places, throughout our cyberdream<br/>
            <br/>
            [Chorus]<br/>
            The future´s on a killing spree<br/>
            We´re ruled by our technology<br/>
            The future´s on a killing spree<br/>
            And made a fool out of eternity<br/>
