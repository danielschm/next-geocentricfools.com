            <h1>Neptunes Limes</h1>
            [Verse 1]<br/>
            There's A trooper on planet Neptune<br/>
            With his blue bar what will you expect to find<br/>
            To find<br/>
            <br/>
            A water with squeezed limes or a life through whole new eyes!<br/>
            <br/>
            [Chorus]<br/>
            OH ALL distance uncertain through a drifting mind<br/>
            Of mine living without beginning and nowhere end in sight<br/>
            <br/>
            OH ALL perfect now a happy vibe<br/>
            No more fights, cause purpose died, or went to hide<br/>
            <br/>
            [Verse 2]<br/>
            There's A rumor, that on planet Neptune<br/>
            Far from lunar you will find the trees of limes<br/>
            Or lies<br/>
            <br/>
            Forbidden fruit in cosmos finding sense which we once lost!<br/>
            <br/>
            [Chorus x3]<br/>
            OH ALL distance uncertain through a drifting mind<br/>
            Of mine living without beginning and nowhere end in sight<br/>
            <br/>
            OH ALL perfect now a happy vibe<br/>
            No more fights, cause purpose died, or went to hide<br/>
            <br/>
