            [Intro]<br/>
            [Verse 1]<br/>
            Today, I had a good good start<br/>
            A light put on, and blossoms in my heart<br/>
            I saw some paintings on the wall<br/>
            As I finally heard your call<br/>
            <br/>
            Utopia is waiting in front of the door<br/>
            <br/>
            Technicolor and a smile is what I got<br/>
            As you watch me in my case I feel a lot<br/>
            My head is in a cave but still I love<br/>
            You for eternity but you might not<br/>
            <br/>
            [Chorus] <br/>
            Utopia is waiting in front of the door<br/>
            You just have to take one step more<br/>
            To get closer to a better better future<br/>
            We program happiness on your computer<br/>
            <br/>
            [Verse 2]<br/>
            Come let me teach you what i mean<br/>
            A lucky me, oh luck will comfort me<br/>
            Never since i was here i’ve shed a tear<br/>
            A joyful you is in my sphere<br/>
            <br/>
            [Outro] <br/>
            Oh, now you’re old and i noticed, <br/>
            For you humans Utopia lies in a moment<br/>
