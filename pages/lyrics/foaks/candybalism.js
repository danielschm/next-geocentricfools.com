            <h1>Candybalism</h1>
            [Verse 1]<br/>
            The wizard man from far above<br/>
            A vision says he`ll visit us<br/>
            Comes down to earth and we will trust <br/>
            A man with wand and golden dust<br/>
            <br/>
            He changed our world to something new<br/>
            All candy, founding a sugarland soon<br/>
            The river`s lemonade, a lolli moon<br/>
            And all of the sudden, we feel blue<br/>
            <br/>
            [Chorus] <br/>
            Rip off their limbs, a sugary sin<br/>
            Addicted to our life within<br/>
            A sweet sweet life<br/>
            Just have a bite, but only one<br/>
            Or you will die<br/>
            Diabetes, diabetes<br/>
            <br/>
            [Verse 2]<br/>
            All we got and all we need<br/>
            Is here with us, but only sweet<br/>
            Oh mallow mounts will break your teeth<br/>
            Our flesh is made of jelly beans<br/>
            <br/>
            We eat, we eat, we never sit<br/>
            Oh harmony, believed in it<br/>
            Till tasty things were gone in weeks<br/>
            We filled our cheeks and noticed that...<br/>
            … If we rip off our limbs<br/>
            <br/>
            [Chorus] <br/>
            We rip off our limbs, a sugary sin<br/>
            Addicted to our life within<br/>
            A sweet sweet life<br/>
            Just have a bite, but only one<br/>
            Or you will die<br/>
            Diabetes, diabetes<br/>
            <br/>
            [Outro] <br/>
            And so we’ll munch on<br/>
            And drink life out vivid, <br/>
            Till the edge of existence, <br/>
            Till our world’s the size of a biscuit<br/>
            And…. (crunch) <br/>
