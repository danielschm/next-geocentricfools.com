            <h1>Moon Lagoon</h1>
            [Verse 1]<br/>
            And soon soon soon<br/>
            It'll feel like sunday afternoon<br/>
            When weekends pass<br/>
            I’ll take a stroll to the past<br/>
            And soon oh soon<br/>
            I’ll have a daze at moon lagoon<br/>
            My dream might last<br/>
            But ‘now’ will only hold me back<br/>
            <br/>
            [Chorus] <br/>
            Taintless state of happiness<br/>
            At moonshine bay<br/>
            Taintless mood of completeness<br/>
            At moon lagoon<br/>
            <br/>
            [Verse 2]<br/>
            Soon soon soon<br/>
            They’ll free a wave and you’ll be doomed<br/>
            Better build a raft<br/>
            Keep following a shallow path<br/>
            And soon oh soon<br/>
            All worries gone at moon lagoon<br/>
            Once you've reached land<br/>
            No ‘now’ will ever hold you back<br/>
            <br/>
            [Chorus] <br/>
            Taintless state of happiness<br/>
            At moonshine bay<br/>
            Taintless mood of completeness<br/>
            At moon lagoon<br/>
            <br/>
            [Outro] <br/>
            Sometimes you just want to daze<br/>
            At a place where there’s sunshine and waves<br/>
            <br/>
            Maybe moonshine bay? <br/>
            Maybe moonshine bay<br/>
