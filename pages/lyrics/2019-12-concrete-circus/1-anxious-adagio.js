            <h1>Anxious Adagio</h1>
            [Verse 1]<br/>
            Feed our hopes with no more sorrow<br/>
            When we reach out for tomorrow<br/>
            Times are hard for us to quit<br/>
            An urgent call for rebellion<br/><br/>
            [Chorus]<br/>
            Tortured creatures rip apart<br/>
            The doubt that lives inside your heart<br/>
            Send your thoughts to somewhere else<br/>
            Then follow with your feet and shell<br/><br/>
            [Bridge]<br/>
            Rotten lights and rusty clouds,<br/>
            Above the law beneath the crowds<br/>
            Forgotten fights on dusty grounds<br/>
            Pursuit the love and feast our sound<br/><br/>
            [Verse 2]<br/>
            Toxic reigns and concrete soils<br/>
            Human veins are drained in oil<br/>
            Teeth are clenched, we raise our voice<br/>
            Castles burn, but water boils<br/><br/>
            [Chorus]<br/>
            Tortured creatures rip apart<br/>
            The doubt that lives inside your heart<br/>
            Send your thoughts to somewhere else<br/>
            Then follow with your feet and shell<br/><br/>
            [Bridge]<br/>
            Rotten lights and rusty clouds,<br/>
            Above the law beneath the crowds<br/>
            Forgotten fights on dusty grounds<br/>
            Pursuit the love and feast our sound<br/>
            <br/>
