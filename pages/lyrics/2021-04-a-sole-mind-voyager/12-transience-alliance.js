            <h1>Transience Alliance</h1>
            [Verse 1]<br/>
            Does he appreciate the feeling of the sound?<br/>
            Does he appreciate the world, that´s going round?<br/>
            Say, does he appreciate the times you might have missed?<br/>
            A shallow disturbance in a coat of a pinkish mist<br/>
            <br/>
            [Verse 2]<br/>
            Does he appreciate the things that you will share?<br/>
            Does he appreciate the eyes through which he´ll stare?<br/>
            Say, does he appreciate transience in every breath?<br/>
            Stuck in an endless loop in the flesh of another head<br/>
            <br/>
            [Chorus]<br/>
            A moment in paradise,<br/>
            In disguise he lives forever<br/>
            The soul once crashed through the sky,<br/>
            With a burst, as the glass would shatter<br/>
            <br/>
            [Verse 3]<br/>
            Does he appreciate the watch, that watches him?<br/>
            Does he appreciate, the sleep, that brings her dreams?<br/>
            Say, does he appreciate his past, that showed him death?<br/>
            An unavoidable part, that makes the future past<br/>
            <br/>
            [Chorus] x2<br/>
            A moment in paradise,<br/>
            In disguise he lives forever<br/>
            The soul once crashed through the sky,<br/>
            With a burst, as the glass would shatter<br/>
