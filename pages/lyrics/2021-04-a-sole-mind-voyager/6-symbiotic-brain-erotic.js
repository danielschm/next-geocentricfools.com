            <h1>Symbiotic Brain Erotic</h1>
            [Verse 1]<br/>
            You melted deep into the dirt<br/>
            Your cap is situated where saplings burst<br/>
            All the energy, you took from earth<br/>
            Flows through your muddy veins since birth<br/>
            He was witness to symbiosis<br/>
            The mushroom man spread his thoughts to the<br/>
            Forest ocean<br/>
            <br/>
            [Chorus]<br/>
            Symbiotic Brain Erotic<br/>
            When two different souls are in the same<br/>
            A reason grows<br/>
            To celebrate<br/>
            Symbiotic Brain Erotic<br/>
            “AH”!<br/>
            <br/>
            [Verse 2]<br/>
            You melted deep into your couch<br/>
            Your cap is situated above the clouds<br/>
            All the energy you wish you found<br/>
            Was hidden in a magic place on the ground<br/>
            He was witness to mycosis<br/>
            The man ate the shroom, lost his focus to<br/>
            all motions<br/>
            <br/>
            [Chorus] x2<br/>
            Symbiotic Brain Erotic<br/>
            When two different souls are in the same<br/>
            A reason grows<br/>
            To celebrate<br/>
            Symbiotic Brain Erotic<br/>
            “AH”!<br/>
            <br/>
            [Bridge]<br/>
            Visions went off-script<br/>
            Symbiotic Brain Erotic<br/>
            The ghost enjoyed a trip to<br/>
            Symbiotic Brain Erotic<br/>
            Visions went off-script<br/>
            Symbiotic Brain Erotic<br/>
            The ghost enjoyed a trip to<br/>
            Symbiotic Gin and Tonic<br/>
            <br/>
            [Chorus] x2<br/>
            Symbiotic Brain Erotic<br/>
            When two different souls are in the same<br/>
            A reason grows<br/>
            To celebrate<br/>
            Symbiotic Brain Erotic<br/>
            “AH”!<br/>
            <br/>
            [Outro] x4<br/>
            When two different souls are in the same<br/>
            A reason grows<br/>
            To celebrate<br/>
            Symbiotic Brain Erotic<br/>
