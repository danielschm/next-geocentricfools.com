            <h1>Around our Playground</h1>
            [Verse 1]<br/>
            Part of me, wants to be a part of you<br/>
            Apparently, your parents see the child in you<br/>
            Crystal clear, we´re all just here and s**t we know<br/>
            Windows clear to your soul, the kid will show<br/>
            <br/>
            [Chorus]<br/>
            We are, not to different<br/>
            All just infants<br/>
            Floating in space<br/>
            Floating in space<br/>
            <br/>
            [Verse 2]<br/>
            Oh, we´re all just simply bubbles in the sea<br/>
            No one knows the sky and where it is to reach<br/>
            We could just enjoy the view passing by our trip<br/>
            'til we reach the surface and that´s it<br/>
            <br/>
            [Chorus]<br/>
            We are, not to different<br/>
            All just infants<br/>
            Floating in space<br/>
            Floating in space<br/>
            We are, not to different<br/>
            All is uncertain<br/>
            Floating in space<br/>
            Floating in space<br/>
            <br/>

            “There is the whole world at your feet and who gets to see it,<br/>
            But the birds, the stars and the chimney sweeps”<br/>
            <br/>
            [Chorus] x2<br/>
            We are, not to different<br/>
            All just infants<br/>
            Floating in space<br/>
            Floating in space<br/>
            We are, not to different<br/>
            All is uncertain<br/>
            Floating in space<br/>
            Floating in space<br/>
            Floating in space<br/>
            Floating in Space...<br/>
