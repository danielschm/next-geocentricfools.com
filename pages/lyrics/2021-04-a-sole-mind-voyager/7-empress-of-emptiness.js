            Nothing crosses the page a blank sheet filled with<br/>
            No thing<br/>
            Nothing, no smile on her face, a tear is shed for<br/>
            No thing<br/>
            Nothing would grow from the shade, cause the rays would shine at<br/>
            No thing<br/>
            Nothing could harm her phrase cause the words consist of<br/>
            No thing<br/>
            Nothing, makes sense at all where death and life are<br/>
            No thing<br/>
            Nothing, liquid from above, the sea is filled with<br/>
            No thing<br/>
            Nothing (that) nihilism solves, ´cause worth belongs to<br/>
            No thing<br/>
            Nothing can be all as long as nothing´s<br/>
            Noticed<br/>
            <br/>
            [Chorus] x2<br/>
            Empress of Emptiness,<br/>
            When nothing seems so seeming less of sense,<br/>
            It´s platitudinous<br/>
            (So everything means anything)<br/>
