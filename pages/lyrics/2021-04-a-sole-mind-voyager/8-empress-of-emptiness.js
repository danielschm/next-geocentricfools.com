            [Verse]<br/>
            I think therefore I am<br/>
            Write these words with my pen<br/>
            A fool in an illusion<br/>
            Put ink to my existence<br/>
            Draw your life to breathe<br/>
            Drawn from life to leave<br/>
            Drained in seas of green<br/>
            Drown in presence, endless dreams<br/>
            <br/>
            [Outro]<br/>
            A poor spirit confronted, with the root of all mysteries<br/>
            Nothing brings Everything<br/>
            And Anything brings Nothing<br/>
        </Container>
