            <h1>Urban Bourbon</h1>
            [Verse 1]<br/>
            I´ve been called by the sound tonight<br/>
            Contentment brings imminent smiles<br/>
            I´ve been lured through the concrete valley<br/>
            Every Blues is a friend, every rock is an ally<br/>
            <br/>
            [Bridge]<br/>
            “I need the rush to dance out of line<br/>
            My limbs are numb, but my spirits high”<br/>
            <br/>
            [Chorus]<br/>
            Heartquake, landscape damage,<br/>
            Way too much for us to manage<br/>
            Animalistic and wild behaviour<br/>
            Randomness a boredom saviour<br/>
            <br/>
            [Verse 2]<br/>
            Urban zoos on our planet blue<br/>
            A bass that chirps infinite loops<br/>
            Fire burns and water extinguishes<br/>
            The flames that I drank, are being diminished<br/>
            <br/>
            [Bridge]<br/>
            “I need the rush to dance out of line<br/>
            My limbs are numb, but my spirits high”<br/>
            <br/>
            [Chorus]<br/>
            Heartquake, landscape damage,<br/>
            Way too much for us to manage<br/>
            Animalistic and wild behaviour<br/>
            Randomness a boredom saviour<br/>
            <br/>
            Heartquake, landscape damage,<br/>
            Way too much for us to manage<br/>
            Animalistic and wild behaviour<br/>
            Randomness a boredom saviour<br/>
            <br/>
            Heartquake, landscape damage,<br/>
            Way too much for us to handle<br/>
            Animalistic and wild behaviour<br/>
            Bourbon is a boredom saviour<br/>
            <br/>
            Bour...Is<br/>
            Ooh ahh yiih<br/>
            <br/>
            But my Spirits high<br/>
            <br/>
            [Chorus] x2<br/>
            Heartquake, landscape damage,<br/>
            Way too much for us to manage<br/>
            Animalistic and wild behaviour<br/>
            Randomness a boredom saviour<br/>
